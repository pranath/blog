## Introduction

In this article we are going to look at some of the most advanced techniques available in 2021 for training deep learning vision models. These go beyond the basics of mini-batch gradient descent, learning rates, pre-sizing, transfer learning, discriminative learning rates, and mixed-precision training.

## Library and Dataset

I will be using the fastai deep learning library for code examples, as well as the fastai curated *Imagenette* dataset which is a specially curated subset of the well known ImageNet dataet of 1.3 million images from 1,000 categories. The Imagenette dataset consists of a much smaller set of images and just 10 categories of images.

We will define a baseline model here using the dataset to then compare the effect of each advanced technique.
